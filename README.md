### Solving Sudoku can be frustating unless you have a script that can solve it for you

## What is Sudoku?

The popular Japanese puzzle game Sudoku is based on the logical placement of numbers. A game of logic, Sudoku doesnâ€™t require any calculation nor special math skills; all that is needed are brains and concentration. Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time. The goal of Sudoku is to fill a 9Ã—9 grid with numbers so that each row, column and 3Ã—3 section contain all of the digits between 1 and 9. As a logic puzzle, Sudoku is also an excellent brain game.

## How to play Sudoku?

The goal of Sudoku is to fill in a 9Ã—9 grid with digits so that each column, row, and 3Ã—3 section contain the numbers between 1 to 9. At the beginning of the game, the 9Ã—9 grid will have some of the squares filled in. Your job is to use logic to fill in the missing digits and complete the grid. Donâ€™t forget, a move is incorrect if:
- Any row contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9
- Any column contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9
- Any 3Ã—3 grid contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9
